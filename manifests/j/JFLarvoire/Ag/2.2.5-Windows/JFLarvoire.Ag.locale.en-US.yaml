ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The setup script now adds an entry in the "Add / Remove Programs" list.
  - This fixes the issue with winget, which did not list The Silver Searcher as installed after successfully installing it.
  - This also allows uninstalling The Silver Searcher either using winget or using the Windows Control Panel.
  - The setup script now detects ag.exe instances installed by Chocolatey or Scoop, and aborts the installation in this case.
